### Project Overview

This project showcases the e-commerce sales details from July 2021, one of the best months during my time as a business owner.<br/>
By analyzing the sales data, I identified the top revenue-generating items and provided business stratgies.


### Data Sources 

[July 2021 Fashion Item Sales Data](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AlsM-EXqeknPdLWj7yXejLridTs?e=1MWaEs&nav=MTVfezVBNzZBNThELTc0QTktNDVGMy1CRDE1LTk2NjdBNUIwNTUxMX0): Contains detailed information on each sold product, including purchase date, price, cost, profit, margin, and tracking number from July 2021, all in Japanese.

### Tools

MS Excel: Data cleaning, data analysis, and report creation.


### Steps
I took the following steps to complete this project:

1. Established business questions such as:
   - What are the sales numbers?
   - What are the popular items in the summer?
   - What were the popular brands in summer 2021?
   - Which dates were the top selling days in July?
   
2. Preprocessing
   - Copied and pasted the original table into a new workbook to prepare the data for analysis.
   - In the second sheet, created an English version of the table, formatted the dates, and removed all empty rows.
   - Added new columns for Brand, ItemCategory, and GenderCategory based on the product items.
    
3. Data Analysis
   - Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) on a separate sheet.
   - Created pivot tables and pivot charts to analyze and visualize the outcomes.
   - Added slicers and a timeline for interactive analysis.
     
4. Report Creation
   - Displayed KPIs and compiled the pivot charts and slicers into a dashboard to highlight all the key points of the July 2021 sales.


### Key Takeaways

- The profit margin was less than 15%, falling short of the goal.
- The top-selling category was sandals.
- Although the profit margin for UGG products was not high, UGG was by far the top brand contributing to overall profit.
- Sales saw an increase at the beginning and end of the month.

### Business Recommendations

- Increase marketing efforts for sandals and other popular categories during peak seasons.
- Explore expanding the product line within the top-performing categories to attract more customers.
- Negotiate better terms with suppliers to increase the profit margin on UGG products.
- Implement targeted marketing campaigns at the beginning and end of the month when sales tend to increase.
- Explore new product lines or brands that may offer higher profit margins.
